## Access summary

An ongoing workshop-style learning group covering DeFi (Decentralized Finance) from first principles.
We focus on how protocols work, risks, and how to use DeFi tools safely with small, controlled experiments.

## What we do

- Understand core primitives: swaps/AMMs, lending/borrowing, collateral, liquidations
- Read a protocol’s docs and identify risks (admin keys, oracle risk, liquidity risk, smart contract risk)
- Practice safe wallet operations (permissions, approvals, revoking allowances)
- Review real incidents to learn threat models and failure modes

## Calls to action

1) Learn the vocabulary (free)
- Ethereum.org DeFi overview: https://ethereum.org/en/defi/

2) Learn about token approvals and safety (free)
- Token approvals (conceptual overview): https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/

3) Run a “paper DeFi” exercise (no money)
- Choose a lending protocol and map: deposit asset → collateral → borrow asset → what triggers liquidation
- Write down the variables you’d monitor (health factor, LTV, oracle price)

## Format (simple and sustainable)

- Ongoing sessions
- Weekly or bi-weekly (small group)
- Bring: one protocol, one question, and one risk you want to understand better
