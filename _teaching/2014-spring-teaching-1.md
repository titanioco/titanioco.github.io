## Access summary

An ongoing learning group focused on understanding Bitcoin and cryptocurrency fundamentals.
We keep it practical: how Bitcoin works, basic security, wallets, transactions, and how to evaluate crypto projects critically.

## What we do

- Explain key concepts with simple mental models (UTXO vs account model, blocks, fees, confirmations)
- Practice safe habits (seed phrases, cold vs hot wallets, common scams)
