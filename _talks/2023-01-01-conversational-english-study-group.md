## Access summary

An ongoing (since 2023) study group to practice conversational English.
We focus on speaking confidence, pronunciation clarity, and steady progress from B1 to C1 using free resources.

## What we do

- Short, repeatable speaking routines (introductions, opinions, storytelling, small talk)
- Pronunciation practice (sounds, stress, rhythm, connected speech)
- Listening + shadowing from real English content
- Friendly feedback with actionable next steps
