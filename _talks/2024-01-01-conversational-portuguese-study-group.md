## Access summary

An ongoing (since 2024) study group to practice conversational Portuguese.
We focus on speaking confidence, pronunciation clarity, and steady progress from intermediate to advanced using free resources.

## What we do

- Short, repeatable speaking routines (introductions, opinions, storytelling, small talk)
- Pronunciation practice (sounds, stress, rhythm, connected speech)
- Listening + shadowing from real Portuguese content
- Friendly feedback with actionable next steps

## Calls to action

1) Take a quick baseline self-check (15 minutes)
- Pick a short topic and record yourself for 60–90 seconds (phone audio is fine)
- Re-listen and note: clarity, speed, fillers, and 3 words you want to improve

2) Choose one free listening track and repeat weekly
- RTP (radio/TV): https://www.rtp.pt/
- YouTube (native content): pick 1 channel you enjoy and stick with it

3) Choose one free grammar/vocab track and follow it consistently
- Duolingo Portuguese: https://www.duolingo.com/
- Memrise (community courses may vary): https://www.memrise.com/

## Pronunciation (free, high quality)

- Forvo (word pronunciations): https://forvo.com/
- YouGlish (hear real examples): https://youglish.com/

## Format (simple and sustainable)

- Ongoing (started in 2024)
- Weekly or bi-weekly sessions (small group)
- Bring: a short topic, a short text/audio clip, and 2–3 questions

If you want, tell me your current level and your main goal (work, travel, exams), and I’ll tailor the session topics and practice routines.
