## Overview

I recently developed a comprehensive Java Swing application that combines multiple powerful features into a single, cohesive platform. This project demonstrates the integration of modern authentication, educational tools, business management capabilities, and AI assistance.

## Key Features

### Secure Authentication
The application implements Google OAuth integration, providing users with a secure and familiar login experience. This ensures that user data and business information remain protected while offering the convenience of single sign-on.

### Interactive Data Structure Visualization
One of the core educational components is the interactive visualization of data structures and algorithms. This feature makes it easier for students and developers to understand complex concepts through visual representation, bringing abstract data structures to life.

### Business Accountability Tools
The application includes comprehensive financial management features:
- Invoicing system
- Financial tracking and reporting
- Compliance management tools

These features make it suitable for small businesses and freelancers who need an all-in-one solution for managing their financial operations.

### AI-Powered Assistance
By integrating with OpenAI and GitHub Models, the application provides intelligent help and guidance to users. This AI assistance can help with everything from answering questions about data structures to providing business insights.

## Technical Implementation

Built with Java Swing, the application features a modern, animated user interface that provides a smooth user experience. The project follows best practices for educational software development, making it both functional and maintainable.

## Project Status

The current version (0.6) represents significant progress in combining educational tools with practical business applications. The project continues to evolve, with plans for additional features and improvements.

You can explore the source code and latest updates on [GitHub](https://github.com/titanioco/Proyectos-Backup/tree/version_0.5).

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how diverse functionalities can be effectively combined into a single application. Whether you're a student learning data structures, a business owner managing finances, or someone who wants AI-powered assistance, this application offers valuable tools in an integrated package.
