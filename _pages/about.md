In appreciation to my friends and family that keept me pusrsuing power through knowledge 

Please explore my code journey from several years in the practice as a code enthusiast and crypto advocat, evolving as part of the engine that maintains the storage servers and later as a Web3 specialist in aims to bring crypto and descentralized finance to the people

My Journey: From Electronics Engineering to Web3 Development
======

My path into technology began at the [Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas](https://www.udistrital.edu.co/), where I studied Electronics and Communications Engineering from 2010 to 2016. This foundation gave me a deep understanding of how systems communicate—knowledge that would prove invaluable as I transitioned into IT infrastructure and eventually blockchain technology.

During my studies, I worked with [COBOL Ingeniería SAS](https://cobol.com.co/), a Colombian technology solutions provider, where I specialized in e-commerce development and sales consulting. I captured client requirements, designed virtual store platforms, and closed deals with potential leads by translating their business needs into effective digital solutions.

From Enterprise Data to Decentralized Systems
------

In 2018, I joined [Sutherland Global Services](https://www.sutherlandglobal.com/) as a **NetApp Support Engineer L1**, where I provided specialized support for [NetApp ONTAP](https://www.netapp.com/ontap-data-management-software/) systems (versions 7, 8, and 9). This role immersed me in the world of enterprise data management—data protection, virtualization, and storage architecture. I engineered test environments using SAN/NAS architecture, worked with [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/) and [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/) hypervisors, and troubleshot high-priority performance issues following strict ETA guidelines.

Working with enterprise storage taught me that **data integrity and availability are everything**—principles that directly translate to blockchain's immutable ledger philosophy. The experience of managing distributed storage systems gave me intuition for how decentralized networks maintain consensus and redundancy.

Building Digital Infrastructure at BOSONS SAS
------

In August 2020, I transitioned to **BOSONS SAS** as an IT Engineer & Security Specialist. Here, I took ownership of the company's entire digital infrastructure, managing a multiplatform online presence that includes:

- **[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)** deployments on [Apache Server](https://httpd.apache.org/)
- Security management through [WHM](https://www.cpanel.net/products/whm/) and [cPanel](https://cpanel.net/)
- [SQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database administration
- [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) for security testing and vulnerability assessments

This role sharpened my security mindset—maintaining server integrity, preventing malware attacks, managing SSL certificates, and ensuring 24/7 website availability. I also developed the ability to translate complex blockchain and technology topics into accessible explanations for customers, a skill that would become central to my Web3 advocacy work.

The Leap into Web3: STACKIT.AI
------

In 2024, my journey culminated in joining [STACKIT.AI](https://stackit.ai/) as a **Front-end Associate & Local Advocate**. This Web3 project represents the convergence of all my previous experience:

- **UI/UX Development**: I refined and enhanced the decentralized application's design system, implementing modern styling frameworks with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), ensuring responsive design across devices
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Leveraging [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) knowledge to bridge complex blockchain logic with intuitive user interfaces
- **Community Building**: Serving as regional advocate, organizing local developer meetups and promoting adoption across Latin America
- **Brand Consistency**: Establishing cohesive visual identity while maintaining Web3 aesthetic principles

The decentralized finance (DeFi) space demands both technical precision and the ability to communicate complex concepts clearly—skills I've honed across every role in my career.

Technical Arsenal
------

My toolkit has evolved to encompass both traditional development and Web3-specific technologies:

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|-------------|
| **Blockchain** | [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/), Smart Contracts, [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/), DeFi Protocols |
| **Frontend** | [React](https://reactjs.org/), JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Responsive Design |
| **Backend** | [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), SQL, [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) |
| **Infrastructure** | [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/), [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/), Apache, Data ONTAP |
| **Security** | [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/), Penetration Testing, SSL/TLS, Security Audits |
| **Tools** | [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), [AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/), [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), Adobe Suite |

Continuous Learning
------

Following the path of knowledge, I've invested in key skills that open doors to global opportunities:

- [Blockchain Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=free&skills=Blockchain) — Understanding mining, consensus mechanisms, and real-world use cases
- [English Proficiency](https://cert.efset.org/N9d4c4) — Reaching C1/C2 level to communicate effectively in international tech communities
- [NetApp ONTAP Certification](https://www.netapp.com/ontap-data-management-software/) — Enterprise-grade data management and virtualization expertise

I'm also proficient in Portuguese and studying Japanese (N5 level), which helps me connect with diverse blockchain communities worldwide.
