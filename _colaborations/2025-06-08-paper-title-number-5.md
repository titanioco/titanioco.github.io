Hey there! 👋

This is just a chill, no-pressure space where we can practice English together at any level. No profit, no formal stuff - just two cats in a roof helping each other get better at conversation.

**What we do:**
- Chat about everyday topics in English
- Share stories and experiences
- Help each other with pronunciation and vocabulary
- Keep it light and fun!


**Locations:**
- We can meet in the campus CyT or la Maca IYKYK
- Some skateparks are good idea too
- I would probably charge to go any other place
- Planing an online meeting too but still is just a sketch 
- Nice and public

**Oh, and sometimes...**
We might geek out about Web3, blockchain, and decentralized tech when the mood strikes. If you're curious about how Web3 is changing the game for creators, communities, and digital ownership, we're happy to share what we know - but zero pressure, it's just one of many cool topics we explore!

Feel free to join us anytime. Everyone's welcome, all levels, all backgrounds. Let's learn together! 🚀🚀🚀
